# FixMarket

FixMarket.org was created between November 2019 and January 2020.

It was written in PHP and uses the following third party code:

TinyMCE
Bootstrap.js

(basically everything in the /dist/ folder is not my own)


Fix Market was intended to be a market place where people with broken devices (phones, computers, consoles etc) could post their job and those who have the necessary skills could make contact and arrange to fix their device for a fee.  There was also the facility to advertise one's services.

I finished most of the website, but didn't have a front page or any sort of promotion/advertising plan in place.

Then Covid-19 happened; I became too busy to take it the final mile and the concept seemed to suffer with social distancing and such, so I shut down apache and zipped FixMarket up with the rest of the failed experiments.

The website is written in PHP, which I still love but many devs now hate.

The bulk of what I would call the "enticing" code is in the /account/ and /do/ folders, everything else is thin gruel.

With some refactoring, you could probably finish this off and use it for something in a similar vain (a basic Buy & Sell, for example).
